    "news2 = \"International University Sports Federation ( FISU ) president Oleg Matytsin yesterday said the term Chinese Taipei has been used for Taiwan's Taipei Summer Universiade teams because the federation must conform to the International Olympic Committee's ( IOC ) Olympic Movement rules. Matytsin made the remark at a news conference in Taipei yesterday, a few hours before the Universiade opening ceremony. He said that delegations from 141 countries , including 7,746 athletes and 3,796 support staff , would be attending the Universiade this year . As of Friday , 119 delegations, including 5,477 athletes and 2,619 support staff , had arrived . The official Universiade media guide had used Chinese Taipei , but later changed it to Taiwan after legislators and the public expressed their discontent . Earlier this month, the Universiade Organizing Committee said that the term Chinese Taipei was changed by the federation during a content review , but the committee changed it back to Taiwan in the geographical introduction section of the guide, and informed the federation . Yesterday , Matytsin said the media guide was not corrected and the change to Taiwan was decided on to introduce the country and its outlying islands . The federation is an IOC-recognized organization , so it has to conform to the Olympic Movement rules and regulations , he said , adding that he knows many people are disappointed about using Chinese Taipei , but the rules must be followed . The flag and team logo must remain as Chinese Taipei . Respect the rules , Matytsin said . Today , I believe it's very important to educate people how to play according to the rules . Matytsin said Taipei has provided high-quality accommodation to athletes and support staff from around the world , and the passion and hospitality shown in Taipei are considered gold-medal standard . For the young athletes attending the Universiade it will be a positive experience and they will likely remember Taipei if they go on to become leaders in sports, business or politics , he said .\"\n",
